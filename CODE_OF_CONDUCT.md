# Code of Conduct for EduPlanner

## Pledge

In the spirit of fostering an open and welcoming environment, I pledge to make participation in this project and its community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive criticism with grace
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards fellow community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Using sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

As the maintainer, I am responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and for taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. I also have the right to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that I deem inappropriate, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation of the project or community includes using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting me directly at [contact@kaelian.dev](mailto:contact@kaelian.dev). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and a response will be provided based on the circumstances. I am obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences, as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
